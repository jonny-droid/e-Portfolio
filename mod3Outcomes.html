<h3>Identify and manage security risks as part of a software development project.</h3>
During this module I was introduced to OWASPS Top 10 Web Application Security Risks. Although I was previously aware of these, by thinking about how
our group application mitigated each of these threats in turn, made me understand the proactive steps needed. One example of this was mitigating against A03:2021-Injection.
We were cautious any time there was an input into our system from a user. Therefore we put the following into place:
<ul>
<li>For image uploads we restricted these to only the following file types: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .gif. This avoided any injection through executable files</li>
<li>We limited the size of the file to mitigate against DDOS attacks (for example uploading files with extremely large amounts of data)</li>
<li>We needed to be confident that input boxes escaped characters, so we used SQLAlchemy due to its built in methods for this (among other reasons, such as working well with our MVC pattern)</li>
</ul>
I did further details into particular security areas:
<ul>
<li><a href="ssd-unit1.html">Writing a discussion post on cross-site scripting.</a></li>
<li><a href="ssd-unit2.html">Writing a a blog post on managing security risks</a></li>
<li>The particular risks, and mitigations, associated with each programming language (looking particulary at C and Python). 
</br><a href="ssd-unit3.html">This took the form of a team discussion</a> and a <a href="ssd-unit3BufferOverflow.html">programming activity on buffer overflows.</a></li>
<li><a href="ssd-unit4.html">ReDoS (a form of DDOS attack exploiting Regex vulnerabilities).</a></li>
<li><a href="ssd-unit8.html">Cryptography</a></li>
</ul> 
Overall my thoughts were how there is a continous arms race between those responsible for applications and those wanting to exploit them. With each new technology released
there are almost instant weaknesses that can be exploited (usually through poor coding or networking practices).
<p></p>
<h3>Critically analyse development problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (including program design and development) to solve them.</h3>
As well as the security issues mentioned above, development problems include: ensuring maintenainbility, readability and good coding quality (for example ensuring reusability of components).
<p>
To help ensure this we learned about:
</p>
Patterns and anti-patterns in unit 3, and implemented this in our group project through using the MVC pattern.
We also tried to avoid spaghetti code.
<p>
To ensure good coding practices, maintenability and readability we learned about Linters. In our group project we used PyLint and Flake8.
This informed us that we were not commenting with an overview of each file . At this point we ran out of time and...

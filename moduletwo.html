Some information systems support parts of the organisation, others, the whole of the organisation.
</br>
Data, Information and Knowledge are key concepts for information systems.</br> 
Data (also called 'raw data') is meaningless on its own.
Information is when you add 'meaning to data' (i.e. data + meaning = knowledge)</br>
Knowledge is understanding using the information.</p>

<h2>Unit 2: Information Systems and their Importance</h2>
</header>
<b><a href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/oopunit2reflections.html">Please see here for my reflections</a></b></p>		
Shelly et al (2016) suggested three core parts of an information system:</br>
<ul>
<li>The Harware (e.g. computers, keyboard etc...)</li>
<li>The software (made up of the OS and Application software) - thse are essentially the instructions that tell the hardware what to do</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>People (e.g. IT staff)</li>
<li>Processes</li>
</ul>	
</br>
It has been suggested that communications should be added to the above. However, technically, Networking belongs in both Hardware and Software.
</p>
The above is what separates Information Systems from Computer Science (CS)). CS is one part of Information Systems.

Object-Oriented programming uses a modular approach, making easier to maintain and ensure flexibility, as blocks can be reused.</p>
A class is like a form/questionnaire. Many instances can be created from a single class.</p>
A class is a blueprint for how something should be achieved, but contains no data itself. In the example below the class of 'dog' specifies its name and age, but does not contain the name of age of any specific dogs. 
<p>
Within relational datbases there are some analogies to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):
<ul>
<li>Classes are similar to entities</li>
<li>States/variables are similar to attributes</li>
<li>Inheritence and composition are similar to relationships</li>
</ul>
There are four main concepts within OOP: encapsulation, inheritence, polymorphism and abstraction.
</p>
Tips from these two weeks:
 <ul>
 <li><i>self.</i> is used as the first parameter of each instance</li>
 <li>can use <i>pass</i> as a placeholder after defining the class.</li>
 <li>Underscores behind the name of a variable, can be used to demonstrate in the code that this should be hidden (essentially a note to developers), e.g. self._example</li></ul>
 
 
 </p>

UML is an industry standard method for graphically showing the artifacts of a software system. 
</br>This is used to save time and costs when creating and modifying information systems.</br> 
It also also means it is possible to gain a high level overview of a system to see if it meets the specification.</br>
UML can be static (shows structure e.g. class diagram) or dynamic (showing a behaviour, e.g. a sequence diagram).</br>
Class diagrams are one of the most commonly used forms of UML diagram.
</p>
Tips from these two weeks:
 <ul>
 <li>A scenario is a sequence of steps desciribing hte interaction between a user and the system</li>
 <li>Abstract class: only exists to be inherited (opposite of concrete class)</li>
  <li>Actors are people or systems who interact with the subject</li>
  <li>Functional requirements are what the system must and must not do (e.g. adds customers). 
  <br>Non-functional requirements are the product properties and user expectations (e.g. it's reliable)</li>
  <li>It is common to leave out the attributes at the early stage of making the UML diagrams</li>
  <li>There are lots of ways to make the requirements, and there is often not a right or wrong answer</li>

										<h2>Unit 7: Database Design</h2></header>
				<b><a href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/DatabaseNormalisation.pdf">Please see here for the artifacts</a></b></br>

A database is a structured approach to data storage.</br>
A database = operational data + a data dictionary (describes strucutre, of database, including relationships between diferent elements, access and manipulation of data).</p>
<p>
Three components make up a database:
<ul>
<li>Entities: take the form of a table</li>
<li>Attributes: the elements that go into making up an entity (they make up a column)</li>
<li>Relationships: how two entities are linked together. Allows us to store linked ata across several tables.</li>
</ul>
</p>
One of the core elements of relational databases are primary (unique identifier in a dable) and foreign keys (a colum in one table that references another table).
<br>
NB: a composite key is where two fields create a unique identifer. E.g. 1st line of an address and postcode form a primary key when combine</br>
</p>
Normalisation aims to ensure the integrity of data and gets rid of redudnant data through stopping multiple copies of the same attribute=</br>
Three rules of normalisation:
<ul>
<li>
1st normal form:
<br>
No collumns have repeated or similar data. E.g. [First name, Surname, Full name]
<br>
Each item cannot be broken down any further (it is <b>atomic</b> (cannot be deposed further, e.g. full name can be decmposed into first name and surname))
<br>
Each row is uniqe, i.e. it has a primary key
<br>
Each field has a unique name (e.g. you not: shoes, colour, colour)
</li>
<li>
2nd normal form:
<br>
Any table that adheres to the 1st normal form and has a simple primary key is automatically in the 2nd normal form. 
Everything in the table should relate to the primary key (if composite primary key then all data needs to relate to both parts of this). E.g. should not have [artist, venue, style] if venue and artist are a compound primary key, as style only depends on artist.
</li>
<li>
3rd normal form: there are no non-key attributes that depend on anotehr non-key attribute. I.e. a value cannot be obtained by refering to another attribute. E.g. [artist, date, city, country], [city,country] should form its own table.
</li>
</ul>

An Entity Relationships Diagram (ERD) is a visual way of showing how parts of a databse relate to each other (e.g. different tables/columns may have a none to many, zero to many etc... relationship).</br>
<p>
Using data from multiple tables requires either 'join' or subqueries (referencing more than one table). One option is not intrinsically better than the other.
</br>
<b><a href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/sqlTips.pdf">Here are some tips for using SQL, including common commands.</a></b>
<p>
<h3>Big data and NoSQL</h3>
Big Data: a field looking at how we can handle the huge amount of data we generate as a society</br>
IBM discussed fours Vs to distinguish Big Data from regular data (reference!!!):
<ul>
<li>Volume (amount of data)</li>
<li>Velocity (speed generated and the amount that it moves around)</li>
<li>Variety (unstructured and difficult to store in a table)</li>
<li>Veracity (accuracny and trustworthiness)</li>
</ul>
NoSQL (Not only SQL) is associated with Big Data. NoSQL is not a single technology, but an umbrella term for database technologies which are flexible, scalable and fast - and are particlarly appropriate for Big Data.</br>
NoSQL is not limitedt to storing data in columns or having conformity across rows.

Where database integrity is important, for example with payment systems, then may wish to rely on SQL.
NoSQL is often part of a wider database management system, including both SQL and noSQL storage.

There are four types of NoSQL databases (not all NoSQL database types fit neatly within these categories):
<ul>
<li>Key-Value: records being stored in pairs (one key to one value). A key is an arbitrary string, for example a file name. A value can be anything as short as a single number or as long as multiple lines of code (such as those stored in a .html file). The value can also be a list.
</li>
<li>Document: each record stored in a document. For example, a medical patietn record documenting everything</li>
<li>Wide-column: columns can vary from row to row. Tables can be created, adjusted and dropped whilst runnin a query</li>
<li>Graph: uses nodes instead of tables.</li>
</ul>

The Model-View-Controller (MVC):</br>
This is a way of thinking about software logic.</br>
The Model represents the data (and nothing else), the View what data is displayed to the user, and the Controller acts between the Model and View (by interpreting user inputs).
</p>
Web frameworks:</br>
A framework is a directly containing resources such as libraries, reference documentation, database access etc… that has already been developed to help you develop your application. Reusable code provides functionality within your programmes. It’s essentially so that you can avoid needing to reinvent the wheel.
Every programming language has its own frameworks (for example JQuery and Javascript).
A web framework includes a built in server and the delegation of responsibility for various parts of your application. It will automate implementation for various common solutions, such as  HTTPS request handling.
Flask is an example of Python web framework (Django is another common example). Flaks offers templating. A template mostly contains HTML, however when you want to add any dynamic behaviour to a webpage you use Jinja.
<P>
Malicious code injections:</br>
In the case of an SQL injection, this sends untrusted code to the web server, e.g. through someone entering SQL code into the URL to fool the web server.

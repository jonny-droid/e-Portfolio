										<h2>Unit 1 - Introduction to Information Systems</h2>
									</header>
									
Some information systems support parts of the organisation, others, the whole of the organisation.
</br>
Data, Information and Knowledge are key concepts for information systems.</br> 
Data (also called 'raw data') is meaningless on its own.
Information is when you add 'meaning to data' (i.e. data + meaning = knowledge)</br>
Knowledge is understanding using the information.</p>

Key terms to look at in the <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a> for this unit:

<li>Unified Modelling Lanugage (UML)</li>

<h2>Unit 2: Information Systems and their Importance</h2>
</header>
Shelly et al (2016) suggested three core parts of an information system:</br>
<ul>
<li>The Harware (e.g. computers, keyboard etc...)</li>
<li>The software (made up of the OS and Application software) - thse are essentially the instructions that tell the hardware what to do</li>
<li>Data</li>
<li>People (e.g. IT staff)</li>
<li>Processes</li>
</ul>	
</br>
It has been suggested that communications should be added to the above. However, technically, Networking belongs in both Hardware and Software.
</p>
The above is what separates Information Systems from Computer Science (CS)). CS is one part of Information Systems.

										<h2>Unit 3: Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Design <p>and</p> Unit 4: Object-Oriented Development and Python
</h2>
									</header>
Object-Oriented programming uses a modular approach, making easier to maintain and ensure flexibility, as blocks can be reused.</p>
A class is like a form/questionnaire. Many instances can be created from a single class.</p>
A class is a blueprint for how something should be achieved, but contains no data itself. In the example below the class of 'dog' specifies its name and age, but does not contain the name of age of any specific dogs. 

Tips from these two weeks:
 <ul>
 <li><i>self.</i> is always the first parameter of each instance</li>
 <li>can use <i>pass</i> as a placeholder after defining the class.</li>
 <li>Underscores behind the name of a variable, can be used to demonstrate in the code that this should be hidden (essentially a note to developers), e.g. self._example</li>
 
 
 </p>

</ul>

<p>
The below example includes demonstrating inheritance. Inheritance has the advantage that we can use use a existing class for new classes. Saves overloading the original class with things that do not apply to most objects.

										<h2>Unit 5: Understanding UML <p>and></p> Unit 6: Hands-on with UML
</h2>
UML is an industry standard method for graphically showing the artifacts of a software system. 
</br>This is used to save time and costs when creating and modifying information systems.</br> 
It also also means it is possible to gain a high level overview of a system to see if it meets the specification.</br>
UML can be static (shows structure e.g. class diagram) or dynamic (showing a behaviour, e.g. a sequence diagram).</br>
Class diagrams are one of the most commonly used forms of UML diagram.
									</header>

Tips from these two weeks:
 <ul>
 <li>A scenario is a sequence of steps desciribing hte interaction between a user and the system</li>
 <li>Abstract class: only exists to be inherited (opposite of concrete class)</li>
  <li>Actors are people or systems who interact with the subject</li>
  <li>Functional requirements are what the system must and must not do (e.g. adds customers). 
  Non-functional requirements are the product properties and user expectations (e.g. it's reliable)</li>
  <li>It is common to leave out the attributes at the early stage of making the UML diagrams</li>
  <li>There are lots of ways to make the requirements, and there is often not a right or wrong answer</li>
 

</ul>

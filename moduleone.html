Unit 2: Introduction to Computer Architecture and the Functionality</h2>
											</header>
														<p>This unit aims to show that binary data (bit) is processed by physical layers of computer hardware.
At the lowest level all information is encoded as 0s and 1s. These are called bits (short for binary digits). 0/1s are just one way of representing them, could be characters in the alphabet or punctuation marks. True/false is another good way to imagine bits.

Memory organisation
In main memory essentially all bits are one long row and that is why an address is needed.
RAM is called Random Access memory because it has the ability to access cells in any order.
Size of memory measured in 1024 bits (called kb as near 1000)
															Note: main memory known as RAM.</br>
	A sequence of bits may represent instructions or data.
															
<p>Main parts of the CPU are: control unit (CU) (refers to location of next instruction), arithmetic logic unit (ALU) (doing the operation on the dat), registers (temporary storage of data), cache, buses and clock</p>

<p>High level programming language statements are mapped down to low level machine instructions, e.g. a Python statement could map to hundreds of low level instructions </p>
<p>Virtualisation provides a way of getting aroudn the constraints of software interaction with different operating systems, software etc...</p>

												<h2> Unit 3: Emerging Trends in Computer Science</h2>
</header>
Cloud services can be categoriesd into the following:
	<ul>
								<li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): your company is provded access to virtualised infrastructure</li>
								<li>Platform as a Service (Paas): similar to Iaas but the provider also provides a platform for you to manage infrastructure, applications etc...</li>
								<li>Software as a Service (Saas): complete product, run and managed by a provider, e.g. web based email</li>
	</ul

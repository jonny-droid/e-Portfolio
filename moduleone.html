<h2>Unit 2: Introduction to Computer Architecture and the Functionality</h2>
</header>
<p>This unit aims to show that binary data (bit) is processed by physical layers of computer hardware.
At the lowest level all information is encoded as 0s and 1s. These are called bits (short for binary digits). 0/1s are just one way of representing them, could be characters in the alphabet or punctuation marks. True/false is another good way to imagine bits.

Memory organisation
In main memory essentially all bits are one long row and that is why an address is needed.
RAM is called Random Access memory because it has the ability to access cells in any order.
Size of memory measured in 1024 bits (called kb as near 1000)
															Note: main memory known as RAM.</br>
	A sequence of bits may represent instructions or data.
															
<p>Main parts of the CPU are: control unit (CU) (refers to location of next instruction), arithmetic logic unit (ALU) (doing the operation on the dat), registers (temporary storage of data), cache, buses and clock</p>

<p>High level programming language statements are mapped down to low level machine instructions, e.g. a Python statement could map to hundreds of low level instructions </p>
<p>Virtualisation provides a way of getting aroudn the constraints of software interaction with different operating systems, software etc...</p>

<h2> Unit 3: Emerging Trends in Computer Science</h2>
</header>
Cloud services can be categoriesd into the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): your company is provded access to virtualised infrastructure</li>
		<li>Platform as a Service (Paas): similar to Iaas but the provider also provides a platform for you to manage infrastructure, applications etc...</li>
		<li>Software as a Service (Saas): complete product, run and managed by a provider, e.g. web based email</li>
	</ul

Networking is a term, means how computers are linked together to share information. Data is transmitted across the internet via 'packets' (please see glossary). 
<p>Covered TCP/IP protocol and OSI protocol</p>

<h2>Unit 5: Software as a Tool - Its Functionality and Development Methodologies</h2>
</header>
One of the problems iwth the software rield traditionally is that software systems are built from th group up and don't rely on already built components from elsewhere (as opposed to modern engineering)</p>
One way of clasifying softare is to divide it into system software (for example the OSs and firewalls) and application software.</p>
There are various software development methodologies. For example:</br>
The waterfall model: software development flows in one direction. An indepth specification is written at the start. Plan > Build > Test > Review > Deploy > Maintain </br>
This method is now largely seen as outdated.
</p>
Agile methods are now commonly used. These are adaptive methods, and is not a one way process(for example, the specification may be constantly adapted whilst writing the software. Prototypes may be made at various steps). The plan at the start minimal</br>
Examples of agile methods include Extreme Programming (XP) and Scrum.
Scrum involves several sprints (bite size pieces of a few weeks). After a sprint review things, and may even rewrite specification. Three main roles: product owner (defines featurs), scru master (leads the team) and the team itself (developrs and tests)
</p>
Types of software documentation:</br>
Technical documentation: how software should be installed, similar to how mechanic has a car manual.</br>
System documentatin: Describes internal mechanics of teh system needed for future maintenance. Means that other people with the software development team can understand the software.</br>
User documentation: To show the end user how to use the software</br>
(Sometimes the user documentation and technical documentation is blurred, as the person installing the software might also be the end-user)
<p>Covered TCP/IP protocol and OSI protocol</p>
One piece of reading that I found interesting was that IT has no central authority controlling the use of terminology and job titles.

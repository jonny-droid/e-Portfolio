<b>NoSQL - example of Key-Value storage</b></p>

Using key-value NoSQL databases involves records being stored in pairs (one key to one value). A key is an arbitrary string, for example a file name. A value can be anything as short as a single number or as long as multiple lines of code (such as those stored in a .html file). The value can also be a list.

According to Davoudian et al (2018) there are a range of data storage needs where a key-value relationship is the best solution. Examples of these include shopping carts and session management. where a single key is needed to access data. In these situations key-value databases are the simplest and most scalable method of storage.

Key-value databases do not use queries and instead rely the following commands: “get” (i.e. retrieve key-value), “put” (i.e. add a key value) and “delete”. Filip and Cegan (2020) write that key-value databases often do not support searches based on values, and even where this is possible, if searching by value is likely required then another type of data storage is preferable.

Originally key-value databases were made with the premise that each key contains one piece of data. With Redis one key can contain millions of other keys, Davoudian et al (2018) argues that this blurs the line of what a key-value database is.

Weise (2015) writes that key-value stores work well as part of a wider database management system, including both SQL and noSQL storage.

<h4>Summary post</h4>
During my original post I focussed on Key-Value types of NoSQL. During the subsequent units I learned more about both SQL and NoSQL, and where it is most is appropriate to use each one.

Reading other people’s posts helped me understand other types of NoSQL technology, for example Graph Database, and how nodes replace tables (this was the NoSQL database I had the most trouble understanding).

During the implementation assignment I learned how to use SQlite and could put into practice the use of creating databases, tables, primary keys, ‘select’ and ‘insert’ statements and joins. I also gained further experience in normalising databases.

One of the key things I learned from reading Wiese (2015) was that different NoSQL technology does not always fit into neat categories, for example:  Key-Value, Document, Graph and wise-column type databases. Han et al (2011) even state that some NoSQL databases can have elements of relational databases in them, for example MongoDB.

I learned how certain NoSQL technologies work especially well with the Object Orientated Programming (OOP) paradigm, especially when it comes to object databases (Leavitt 2010).

Reading about SQL helped me understand the topic of SQL injection covered in Unit 11. SQL injection is where a user inputs query language to maliciously gain access to, or edit, data.</p>

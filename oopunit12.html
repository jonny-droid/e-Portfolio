	<h2>Blog Post: Emerging Trends in Information Systems</h2>
									<p>
    The development of Bitcoin introduced Blockchain technology to the world
    (previously only existing in a research context) (Strawn 2019).
</p>
<p>
    A blockchain is made up of blocks. Each block contains (Williams 2019):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Some data (this depends on the blockchain, for example bitcoin
        contains: sender, receiver, and number of points/amount of bitcoin).
    </li>
    <li>
        The hash of the block (like a fingerprint, it is unique and identifies
        a block). Changing something inside the block will cause the hash to
        change. If it changes then it no longer is the same block. The hash
        ensures the content of the block has not been changed, but does not
        reveal the specifics inside the block.
    </li>
    <li>
        The hash of the previous block (this creates a chain of blocks and what
        makes blockchain so secure). If someone tampers with, for example, the
        second block then the hash of the block changes then this causes all
        subsequent blocks to become invalid.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Williams (2019) and Strawn (2019) write that there are further security
    mechanisms within blockchain. One of these is proof-of-work. This mechanism
    slows down the creation of new blocks. This makes it too time-consuming to
    tamper with a block, as you have to recalculate all other blocks in the
    chain.
</p>
<p>
    Williams (2019) and Strawn (2019) write that peer-to-peer networks add to
    the above security mechanisms. A digital ledger is shared between all
    participants in the chain and cannot be amended or deleted. Blockchain is
    not managed by any centralised entity. Anyone is allowed to join, and when
    they do, they get a full copy of the blockchain. All nodes of the network
    need consensus, so if anyone tampers with a block they would need to
    control the other users on the peer-to-peer network to be successful.
    Consensus is needed to create new blocks.
</p>
<p>
    Williams (2019) makes the argument that blockchain will impact every
    section of technology. Including, but not limited to, IOT devices,
    logistics, healthcare, networking and finance.
</p>
<p>
    Taking the example of healthcare, Tanwar et al (2020) state that blockchain
    could be used for decentralised storage of and retrieval of patient
    healthcare records. Providing a means of verifying and ensuring the
    integrity of patient data. All healthcare providers could be part of the
    blockchain architecture and patients are in possession of a private key.
    Then, when a healthcare provider has to access blockchain they will access
    the patient’s public ID (containing no personal information) and the
    patient provides the private key (blockchain intrinsically contains a high
    level of encryption and from just having the hash the content of the block
    is not readable).
</p>
<p>
    One of the biggest downsides to blockchain technology is energy
    consumption. Corbet et al (2010) write that Bitcoin uses the energy
    consumption of a small developed country due to the processing power that
    is involved. This has major cost and environmental implications for using
    Blockchain technology in other areas of life. However, Bitcoin is necessary
    data-intensive, as the creation of new Bitcoin, through mining, needs to be
    processor-heavy, as if it could be created with ease then it would lack the
    main feature of physical currency (i.e. it cannot be created easily)
    (Williams 2019). Blockchain uses a cryptographic, computationally intensive
    puzzle to create new Bitcoin. Sedlmeir et al (2020) write that other areas
    of blockchain do not need the features contained in Bitcoin and therefore
    would not have to be so energy-intensive.

    Incident:
</p>
<p>
    On 12th May 2017 34 National Health Service (NHS) trusts became infected by
    the WannaCry ransomware attack. This malware encrypted files, requesting
    users to pay in bitcoin to unlock their device. Staff were locked out of
    key information systems, including those used to store and retrieve patient
    medical records and those used for accessing and using medical equipment
    (such as MRI scanners). The NHS Trusts responded by shutting down their
    networks, suspending email, and denying access to external links. Staff
    resorted to notetaking on paper and lacked patient records to refer to.
    This took several hours to restore.
</p>
<p>
    The cause of this was:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Failure at the hardware component of NHS information systems (using
        devices running Windows XP after this was no longer supported).
    </li>
    <li>
        Failed cyber security practices/procedures. Even though XP was no
        longer supported, Windows released a security fix for the vulnerability
        exploited by WannaCry. The effected NHS Trusts had not implemented this
        security patch.
    </li>
    <li>
        Possible inadequacies within the relevant networks allowed the malware
        to spread to other connected devices.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Consequences:
</p>
<p>
    Due to not being able to access key NHS information systems and equipment:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        19,000 appointments were cancelled
    </li>
    <li>
        The cost to the impacted NHS trusts was estimated to be over £10
        million.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Feedback from peers</h3>
<h4>Feedback 1</h4>
<p>
    It goes to show that the weakest component in an IT system continues to be
    the human factor.
</p>
<p>
    The Department was warned about the risks of cyberattacks on the NHS a year
    before, but did not formally respond with a written report until July 2017.
    The attack could have caused more disruption if it had not been stopped by
    a cyber researcher activating a ‘kill switch’ which stopped WannaCry from
    locking more devices.

    Hi Jonathan. It seems that the issue of updating or patching vulnerability
    of an IT system, including the outdated Microsoft Window of your case, is a
    rather common cause of the information system failure. Similar failure
    occurs in the case I searched. Data of the Equifax breached through a
    vulnerable Apache Struts Web Framework server, which was not patched since
    the administrator missed the critical security patch. In addition to an out
    of date mailing list, the system administrator also failed to receive the
    email sent from the security officer regarding the incorrectly configured
    database.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Therefore, human or administration failure serves as one of the main causes
    in both incidents. Higher priority should be given to continuous updating
    of the operation system and all software related to the IT system and
    security vulnerability patching for any information system, which are
    suggested to be conducted on a regular and restricted basis. For instance,
    as suggested by the Secure Team (2019), monthly patching cycles can be
    better implemented efficiently by using network segmentation and
    automation.

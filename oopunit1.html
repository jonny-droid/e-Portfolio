    Incident:
</p>
<p>
    On 12th May 2017 34 National Health Service (NHS) trusts became infected by
    the WannaCry ransomware attack. This malware encrypted files, requesting
    users to pay in bitcoin to unlock their device. Staff were locked out of
    key information systems, including those used to store and retrieve patient
    medical records and those used for accessing and using medical equipment
    (such as MRI scanners). The NHS Trusts responded by shutting down their
    networks, suspending email, and denying access to external links. Staff
    resorted to notetaking on paper and lacked patient records to refer to.
    This took several hours to restore.
</p>
<p>
    The cause of this was:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Failure at the hardware component of NHS information systems (using
        devices running Windows XP after this was no longer supported).
    </li>
    <li>
        Failed cyber security practices/procedures. Even though XP was no
        longer supported, Windows released a security fix for the vulnerability
        exploited by WannaCry. The effected NHS Trusts had not implemented this
        security patch.
    </li>
    <li>
        Possible inadequacies within the relevant networks allowed the malware
        to spread to other connected devices.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Consequences:
</p>
<p>
    Due to not being able to access key NHS information systems and equipment:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        19,000 appointments were cancelled
    </li>
    <li>
        The cost to the impacted NHS trusts was estimated to be over £10
        million.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How people can be managed to overcome cyber security risk</span></h3>
<p><strong>Access control</strong></p>
<p>The principle of least privilege should be adhered to (OWASP, N.D.). This means that if any staff need to apply for higher levels of permissions there must be clear processes involved, conditions that need to be met, and rules on who grants these privileges.</p>
<p><strong>Audit</strong></p>
<p>IT security audits should be conducted by either the company itself or an external provider. In terms of people management, Stafford et al (2018) write that the findings of these audits should inform staff training and future IT security policies.</p>
<p><strong>Information need:</strong></p>
<p>GDPR (ICO, 2021) states that any information collected needs to have legitimate cause for being stored, and personal data should be destroyed after it is no longer needed. In the organisation I work for the length of data storage must be determined prior to collection, and this is reviewed by the data protection/legal team annually.</p>
<p><strong>Event</strong></p>
<p>If an incident happens GDPR legislation requires that this be reported within 72 hours to the ICO (ICO, 2021). This means that an organisation needs to have processes to ensure staff know to notify their Data Protection Officer, who will then notify the ICO. Staff need to be trained on these processes and when they are to be invoked.</p>
<p><strong>Policy</strong></p>
<p>All the above suggests that there need to be clearly accessibly policies available for staff. These may indicate areas such as, what happens with remote access (for example connecting to the company&rsquo;s VPN), which incidents to report and how to report these (Violina, 2021). For policies staff both need to be trained in these and know where to find them (for example on their company&rsquo;s intranet). From my own experience, it is important that older policies are archived when further ones added. Policies can also be enforced technically/automated, such as requiring a certain password complexity and encrypting any storage devices.</p>
<p><strong>Training</strong></p>
<p>All the above point to the importance of training. Florentina et al (2016) state that data protection training should take place for all staff annually, with further training in between &ldquo;as required&rdquo;. This may involve in-person or online training, along with an assessment. I would suggest, that at the same time as this, more general IT security training should be given.</p>

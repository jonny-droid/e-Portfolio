<button class="accordion"><h2>A - B - C</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
	<h1><u>A</u></h1>
	<u>Abstraction (programming)</u>: reducing a complex problem to a simplified version. In OOP, it relates to only focussing on the necessary deatils, for example, abstract class can be created to supply what is needed to subclasses (even when the class is not used in itself.
	Can also refer to abstracting away the details for only the entities that need to see it.</ul></p> 
	<p><u>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</u> When computers perform a task which is commonly associate with a human being.
	<p><u>Assembly language:</u></p> a low-level programming language that is used to communicate directly with a computer's hardware.
	<h1><u>B</u></h1>
	<p><u>Bridge:</u>Connects 2 networks to become as one. People won't feel like moving between LAN 1 and LAN 2, for example. Only works where on the samet ype of network.</p>
	<p><u>Byte:</u> Memory is usually organised into cells (bytes). A cell = 8 bits. A byte is represented by two hexidemicals (as one hexidecimal represents 4 bits).
A cell usually has a high to low end order.
		High end (more significant bits) > 01001101 <Low end (less significant bits)</p>
	<h1><u>C</u></h1>

<p><u>Cache:</u> a tiny bit of RAM exists in the CPU (called SRAM - much faster than normal RAM). </p>
<p><u>Casting:</u>converts data from one type to another, e.g.an integer to a string.</p>
<p><u>Code refractoring:</u> A Dev Ops concept for editing and cleaning up previously written code without changing how it functions.</p>
<p><u>Computational artefact:</u> anything created by a human using a computer (e.g. a programme, video, web page, image etc…).</p>
<p><u>Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools:</u> software tools to simplify the software development process (like how CAD is used in engineering). IDE's are an example of a CASE tool</p>
<p><u>Cyclometric complexity:</u>worked out through counting the number of decision points. Usually better to have a lower cyclometric complexity. A hihg score may indicate that refractoring is necessary.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"><h2>D - E - F</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<h1><u>D</u></h1>
	<p><u>Data mining:</u> differs from database enquiry in that it looks to identify unique patterns, rather than just retrieving stored facts.</p>
	<p><u>Distributed computing:</u>Multiple computers on the same network work together through passing messages to achieve a common goal.</p>
	<p><u>Double strength encryption:</u>using multiple keys so that if someone intercepts one key then they can’t decrypt the data.</p>
<h1><u>E</u></h1>
<u>Entity:</u> a thing of interest to an organsiation which has data recorded. Forhttps://getbootstrap.com/ example a student. An entity usually takes the form of a table</p>
<p><u>Encapsulation:</u> data hiding/an object should only revewal its essential details. Also can refer to the collection of related data and procedures into a class. Encapsulation is the process and abstraction is what is being facilitated</p>
<h1><u>F</u></h1>
	<u>Flip flop:</u> a fundamental unit of computer memory. Remains a zero or one until told otherwise. A modern computer chip contains millions of flipflops
		</div>
<button class="accordion"><h2>G - H - I</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<h1><u>G</u></h1>
	<p><u>Garbage collection:</u>automates teh release of memory that it used and no longer needed back to the system. Python, and some other high level programming languages do this.</p>
	<p><u>Gate/Logical gate:</u> a device which produces a booloan operation.</p>
	<p><u>Gateway:</u>Generic term. Could be a router, a special type of bridge or other device. Connects two different networks that would otherwise be incompatible.</p>
	<p><u>GNU project:</u></p>
<h1><u>H</u></h1>
	<p><u>Hexadecimal notation:</u> This takes advantage of the fact that bit pattens usually have length of multiples of 4. A hexadecimal notation uses a single symbol to represent a pattern of four bits. Hexadecimals are usually prefixed by “0X”.</p>
	<p><u>HTML:</u>Essentially a way of intructing browser how to display a webpage toa user. "Hypertext" means taht it it it contains tags describing how the document is displayed and links ot other documents.</p>
	<p><u>Hybrid crytopgraphy</u>using multiple approaches/multiple cyphers</p>
<h1><u>I</u></h1>
<p><u>Inheritence:</u>DRY (Don't repeat yourself). <a href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/moduletwo.html">See OOP module</a></p>
<u>Internet:</u> A worldwide network of networks.
		</div>
<button class="accordion"><h2>J - K - L</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<h1><u>J</u></h1>
<h1><u>K</u></h1>
<h1><u>L</u></h1>
	<u>Latency:</u>the time a system takes from a request to a response. E.g. the response time for an ennd user from a web application. The lower the latency the faster the time.</p>
	<u>Levels of abstraction:</u> hierarcy with machine code being at the lowest level (think of lowest level being closest to electronics).
		</div>
<button class="accordion"><h2>M - N - O</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<h1><u>M</u></h1>
<p><u>MAC address:</u> A unique address for the network adapter on your device.</p>
	<p><u>Machine language:</u> collection of machine instructions consisting of binary or hexidecimal which the computer can respond directly to.</p>
	<p><u>Motherboard:</U>the primary device connecting the innards of System Unit together (.e.g. CPU, RAM etc…)</p>
	<p><u>Mutibility:</u>Whether objects once created can be changed<a href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/moduletwo.html">See OOP module</a></p>
<h1><u>N</u></h1>
<u>Networking:</u> How computers are linked together to share information.
<h1><u>O</u></h1></div>
<button class="accordion"><h2>P - Q - R</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<h1><u>P</u></h1>
<p><u>Packets:</u> Blocks of data. Treated as unrelated messages, and may travel a completey different route, until they reach the transport layer at their final destination.</p>
<p><u>Parallel computing:</u>Uses mulitple processes. The workload is divded between more than one processor. A single computer with processors connected through a bux (used heavily in supercomputers))</p>
	<u>Polymorphism:</u> A method can be activiated and modified by a subclass/child class.</p>
	<u>Pointers: used by assembly langauges. Is an address for the variable's location in memory</u>
	<u>Pointers: </u>
	<u>Poison package:</u>when installed it achieves a functionality but also performs a negative behaviour(e.g. information leakage). An example might be from a library you install.
	<u>Programming language:</u> is used for people to express algorithms to a computer at a higher level of abstraction than binary.
<h1><u>Q</u></h1>
<p><u>Quality attribute:</u>a testable non-functional requirements used to evaluate the performance of a system. Important to an archtect. Import examples are: modifiability, testability, scalability and performance, availability, security and deployability.</p>
<p><u>Queue:</u>a fundamental data strcture where the item <u>least</u> recently added is removed. Last in last out.</p>
<h1><u>R</u></h1>
<u>Recursion:</u>a function calling itself again and again to complete a task.
<u>Router:</u> Only device with a connection to the outside world.
<p><u>Runtime:</u>The process/length of tiem it takes teh CPU to execute your code</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion"><h2>S - T - U - V</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<h1><u>S</u></h1>
	<p><u>Source code:</u>human readable code. What is typed by the programmer into the computer.</p>
	<p><u>Stack:</u>a fundamental data strcture where the item <u>most</u> recently added is removed. Last in first out.</p>
	<p><u>Stream:</u> a long string of bits, e.g. 0111000111.....</p>
	<p><u>Switch:</u>knows MAC addresses for computers on the network, so know which other computer to make a direct physical connection to send data to. Have largely superceded hubs.</p>
<h1><u>T</u></h1>
<u>Testability:</u> the most testable a system the less easily it can hide its faults.
<h1><u>U</u></h1>
<u>Unified Modelling Language (UML): a language for specifying, visualising, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems</u>
<u>URL:</u>Unique Resource Locator - unique address to locate and retrive each document.
<h1><u>V</u></h1></div>
<u>Virtualisation:</u>the creation of a virtual (i.e. not a real) version of something, such as an operating system (OS), a server, a storage device or network resources.
<button class="accordion"><h2>W - X - Y - Z</h2></button>
<div class="panel">
<h1><u>W</u></h1>
<h1><u>X</u></h1>
<u>XML</u> Like HTML but with no user predefined user tags (you crate these yourselves). XML separates information from presentation and focuses on conveying data (HTML focusses on how data looks)
<h1><u>Y</u></h1>
<h1><u>Z</u></h1>

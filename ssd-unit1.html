<h3>My initial post</h3>
<p>Cross site scripting</span></p>
<p>This post looks at OWASP A1:2017-Injection (OWASP, 2020). The activity diagram specifically demonstrates reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). 
This is a client-side attack where a hacker constructs a custom URL which executes JavaScript in the victim&rsquo;s browser. 
This can be used to carry out an action or to send data to the hacker (Ambedkar and Ambedkar 2016).</p>
<p>Other examples of cross-site scripting includes (Dora and Nemoga, 2021):</p>
<ul>
<li>Dom based XSS: attackers add malicious code to a webpage. This is a client-side attack. Dora and Nemoga (2021) state that some authors regard this as a type of reflected attack, 
however it does not include any data being sent to the server.</li>
<li>Stored/persistent XSS: attackers store malicious code on a website&rsquo;s database. This is often accomplished through a search field, with a hacker adding 
Javascript/HTML into a search box or form. This is a server-side attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rodriguez et al (2020) list some methods to prevent cross-site scripting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blacklist certain user inputs, for example &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; and &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Escaping characters so code is interpreted as text and not run.</li>
<li>Using open sources XSS libraries.</li>
<li>Tools exist that can be used to automatically detect cross site scripting vulnerabilities (OWAST 2021). OWAST lists nine of these.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Feedback 1</h4>
<p>
    It goes to show that the weakest component in an IT system continues to be
    the human factor.
</p>
<p>
    The Department was warned about the risks of cyberattacks on the NHS a year
    before, but did not formally respond with a written report until July 2017.
    The attack could have caused more disruption if it had not been stopped by
    a cyber researcher activating a ‘kill switch’ which stopped WannaCry from
    locking more devices.

    Hi Jonathan. It seems that the issue of updating or patching vulnerability
    of an IT system, including the outdated Microsoft Window of your case, is a
    rather common cause of the information system failure. Similar failure
    occurs in the case I searched. Data of the Equifax breached through a
    vulnerable Apache Struts Web Framework server, which was not patched since
    the administrator missed the critical security patch. In addition to an out
    of date mailing list, the system administrator also failed to receive the
    email sent from the security officer regarding the incorrectly configured
    database.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    Therefore, human or administration failure serves as one of the main causes
    in both incidents. Higher priority should be given to continuous updating
    of the operation system and all software related to the IT system and
    security vulnerability patching for any information system, which are
    suggested to be conducted on a regular and restricted basis. For instance,
    as suggested by the Secure Team (2019), monthly patching cycles can be
    better implemented efficiently by using network segmentation and
    automation.

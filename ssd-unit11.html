										<h2>Artifact for units 11: debate on Microservices and Microkernels</h2>
										</header>
<h2>Personal resoponse</h2>	
<p>This post relates to the debate between Tanenbaum (creator of MINIX) and Torvalds (the main developer behind Linux) on an online forum in 1992 (DiBona Ockman, 1999). This post focuses on whether, all things considered, Microkernels are superior to Monolith Kernels (a view posited by Tanenbaum).</p>
<p>There is general agreement that Linux still uses a monolith kernel and MacOS uses hybrid kernel (combining aspects of the two types of kernels) (Papadimitriou & Moussiades, 2018; Odun-Ayo Isaac et al, 2021). There is some debate about whether Windows uses a monolith kernel (supported by Papadimitriou and Moussiades, 2018) or hybrid kernel (supported by Malallah et al, 2021).</p>
<p>I would state that Tanenbaum is incorrect. Although there is still debate within academia about the merits and drawbacks of micro (more secure, easier to debug and add new functionality) and monolith kernels (faster) (see Odun-Ayo Isaac et al, 2021), the fact that no major modern operating systems uses a microkernel suggests that Tanenbaum is wrong. Linux is used widely on servers and 73% of phones worldwide (via Android) (Statista, 2021), and this suggests that Monolith kernels are not flawed as Tenenbaum suggested (DiBona &amp; Ockman, 1999). Evans (2014) argues that if Microkernels are superior then computing innovation has taken a wrong route over the last couple of decades due to their limited adoption.</p>

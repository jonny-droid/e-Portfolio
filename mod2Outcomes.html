<p>
    For the
    <a href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/oopunit1.html">
        Unit 1-3 collaborative discussion
    </a>
    I looked at information system failure, using the specific example of a
    ransomware attack on the NHS in 2017. I looked at both the causes and costs
    of this. I also read through and commented on peersâ€™ posts to gain
    understanding of different incidents in a range of sectors. The
    collaborative discussion was preceded by reading and viewing lecturecasts
    to properly understand what constitutes an information system.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Design or modify and document an object-oriented information system
        using appropriate tools

</p>
<p>
    The
    <a href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/oopunit5-6.html">
        activity in unit 5/6
    </a>
    involved creating a UML Object diagram that could be implemented using
    Object Orientated Programming (for example using Python).
</p>
<p>
    The mid-module assignment involved creating class, activity and state
    diagrams. This involved applying the concepts of inheritance, composition,
    encapsulation and abstraction.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Develop an object-oriented information system design, implementing this
        knowledge in applicable programming languages, such as Python and SQL
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    For
    <a href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/oopunit3-4.html">
        units 4 and 5
    </a>
    , I used what I learned on Codio to show an example of inheritance. This is
    a key concept in object-orientated programming, and I wanted to remember it
    by adding an example created on IDLE to my e-portfolio.
</p>
<p>
    The System implementation involve me using the diagrams created in the
    mid-module assignment to create an information system using Python and
    SQlite. There were certain modifications I made during the implementation
    which I documented in the ReadMe file.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <a
        href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/PDFs/DatabaseNormalisation.pdf"
    >
        SQL activity in unit 7
    </a>
    involved normalising a database through creating multiple tables with
    primary and foreign keys. This helped me understand the advantages of using
    relational databases, such as data integrity and efficiency.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Develop, implement and evaluate critically information system solutions
        to facilitate business decisions
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    During the
    <a href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/oopunit8-10.html">
        collaborative discussion in units 8, 9 and 10
    </a>
    I looked at NoSQL, focussing on key-value storage. I looked at how this
    provides a simple scalable approach to certain processes, including
    shopping carts and session management (i.e. when a single key is needed to
    access data). I concluded that a business could find value in implementing
    key-value storage among other relational and non-relational databases.
</p>
<p>
    The
    <a href="https://jonny-droid.github.io/e-Portfolio/oopunit12.html">
        unit 12 artifact
    </a>
    was a blog post documenting an emerging trend in Information Systems. I
    chose to focus on Blockchain technology. I critically evaluated the
    benefits (such as helping to transform patient information in healthcare)
    and the costs (most significantly energy consumption) to businesses when
    deciding to use this technology.

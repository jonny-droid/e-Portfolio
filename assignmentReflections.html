    <strong>Mid module assignment</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The mid module assignment involved creating UML class, activity and state
    diagrams for an online shop. This assignment was to produce a framework
    (meeting learning outcome two) for the system implementation assignment.
</p>
<p>
    I found the feedback I received extremely useful. This stated that
    additional classes for <em>payment</em> and <em>shipment</em> would have
    helped fulfil the full requirements of the system. I also received feedback
    stating that there were some activities missing from the activity diagram,
    for example the customer needs to open the online store before they can
    search for their product. My state diagram could have benefits from adding
    conditional logic where appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>System implementation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This assignment helped me apply all the key concepts covered from units 1
    to 10. My knowledge of object orientated programming (OOP) increased
    exponentially through completing this assignment as it allowed me to bring
    together all the principles I have learned.
</p>
<p>
    The overarching structure of the assignment was to create an information
    system (as covered in units 1 and 2), it involved a knowledge of OOP
    principles (inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism)
    covered in units 3 and 4. I implemented my UML diagrams (as covered by
    units 5 and 6). I used the database design principles (covered in units
    7-10) through normalising an SQlite relational database. As part of the
    assignment I did some preliminary work on using JSON to store and query the
    data, but decided against this as a result of the limitations discussed in
    units 8 and 9. Given more time I would have considered using a python web
    framework as learned about in unit 11.
</p>
<p>
    It was not until I started to code my system that I fully understood the
    shortcomings of my UML diagrams, especially in regard to having classes for
    payment and shipping would have been.
